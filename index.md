I'm currently in my second semester of the Master of Science in Business Analytics program at the University of Iowa. I enjoy learning about web scraping and big data management. I'm looking for a data analyst position starting in early 2023.

My hobbies include spending time with family, watching sports, and traveling. I enjoy combining my interests in baseball and data to better evaluate players.

Below are some of my previous projects.
